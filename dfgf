cost function :  is used to measure just how wrong the model is in the finding a relation betn the independent and dependent variable. (J)
for linear regression : cost function = min of root of mean squared error = predicted - actual values
for neural network :  sum of error in each layer

Gradient Decent : alogorithm used to optimized cost function or error of model
                  find min value of error possible in model
