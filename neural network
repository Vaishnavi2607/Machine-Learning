Neural Natwork:

Network of neuron with multiple layers


Types:
Supervised learning:
1.  Neural natwork / Simple neural network (snn) / neural network with Back propagation
2.  CNN Convulation Neural Network
3.  RNN Recurrent Neural Network
4.  LSTM long short memory neural network

Unsupervised learning:



SINGLE NEURON ARCHITECTURE:
also known as PERCEPTON or svm machine.

two parts of neuron
1.summation : every input is assigned some weightage 
X= b0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + ..... + wnxn 
sum all multiplication of weightage of inputs and biased
2.activation function: what will the output based on summation. transform summation value to y
y=f(X)
where X= b0 + w1x1 + w2x2 + ..... + wnxn 


Intutuion of multilayer nn architecture:
input -> Gross Feature -> Subtle -> Output Formating -> output
all layers between input and output id hidden layer

input layer : (placeholder) takes input from user
output layer : gives the output to the user
Gross layers : some extract gross features
Subtle layers : exart detailed features
output formatting : formatting the output
