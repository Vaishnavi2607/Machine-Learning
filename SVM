Support Vector Machine :

used only for binary classification or regression
it can handle linear/ non linear boundary

Goal: find the decision boundary between two classes with maximum margin

Margin is based on samples close to the boundary. these samples are called "Support Vector"

Margin :- Minimum distance between proposed boundary and closest point(s) from each class

Which boundary to choose :
single dataset may have multiple possible boundaries between two classes
boundary with maximum margin is most beneficial
such boundary avoids misclassification even if there is some deviation in new data from original data

Binary classification:
- Points which are on either side of the boundary are given to respective class
- for new point class is predicted by using which side of the boundary it is.(0 or 1)

Regression:
- using decision boundary linear equation is formed
- this is transformed into probability using logistic function
- Output of logistic function is used for regression.


svm  transforms the data in the hyperspace in a way that it can be linearly seperated.

Transforms the data by adding non - linear features.
(x^2, cos(x) , x^5, convert points in form of polar coordinates etc)
this enables to have linear boundary between classes.

KERENEL does this transform efficiently only once and not every iteration.
types of kernel:
1. Polynomial kernel
2. RBF Kernel
3. Linear Kernel

RBF Kernel : - Radial basis Function/ Gaussian Kernel
- Considers all posible polynomial of all degree representation of features.
- Polynomial Features with higher degrees are given less importance.

RBF(x,x') = exp(-gamma || x-x'||) = =exp(-gamma(summation(x-x')^2))
[||x-x'|| -> second norm]
[-gamma(summation(x-x')^2) -> similarity between x and x']


SVM parameters 
C : regularization parameter (l2 penalty)
  -  higher value less regularization / more misclassification is allowed
  -  Always Positive 
advantage : when we keep high value of c it is faster

Kernel : 'linear' , 'rbf'

gamma : when kernel is rbf
  -  how much each support vector impacts
  -  less value : more support vectors are selected. (slow process).
  -  High value : less support vectors are selected (fast process).
  -  Need fine tuning.
